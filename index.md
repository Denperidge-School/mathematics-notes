# Cats Mathematics Notes

(I don't wanna fail again)

Notes for the final:

- Write down <u>all</u> your steps, just the solution tends to not be enough
- 4 numbers after the comma`,` or you're going to math jail
- We can use [the formularium](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211721?module_item_id=504258) during the entire thing
- Also there was an attempt to collect the things the teacher said about possible questions on the final so like check that out [here](examenvragen/)
- Try to go for a minimum of 4 steps when calculating/mathening
- Use table in canvas for tekenverloop
- Learn how to work with the browsers calculator (Canvas' I assume?)

General notes:

- Also [here's most of our course & exercises](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211970?module_item_id=504417) (besides ch9's [course](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211716?module_item_id=504262) & [exercises](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211735?module_item_id=504261) )
- If you for some reason think theses notes look good, I wrote down how I make them [here](https://github.com/Denperidge-School/mathematics-notes#readme)
