# Cats Mathematics Notes

(I don't wanna fail again)

Notes for the final:

- Write down <u>all</u> your steps, just the solution tends to not be enough
- 4 numbers after the comma`,` or you're going to math jail
- We can use [the formularium](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211721?module_item_id=504258) during the entire thing
- Also there was an attempt to collect the things the teacher said about possible questions on the final so like check that out [here](examenvragen/)
- Try to go for a minimum of 4 steps when calculating/mathening (otherwise it can be a 0)
- Use table in canvas for tekenverloop
- Learn how to work with the browsers calculator (Canvas' I assume?)
- Controle (zoals in [extra les 5](les-5-extra)) kan gevraagd worden
- The final will be taken in school, on laptops. This will only change if the government decides against it.
- Bringing an extension cable and charging your laptop beforehand is recommended
- Some formulas can be typed down regularly, but with breuken and the like, use the formula editor
- 7-8 exercises over 3 hours. People good at maths can be done in 1, slightly good can be done around 2.
- Take the following with you:
    - Writing equipment (pen or pencil)
    - 'Gradenboog' (mainly for the next final in january) if a graph has to be drawn (if this is gonna be the case, that'll be on a seperate paper that *will* be graded)
- You get *kladpapier* (nice English, me) from the school, you're not allowed to bring your own. You have to hand them in afterwards, but you won't be graded on them.
- There are "theoretically" 49 different versions of the final
- The final isn't compartmentalized per chapter

General notes:

- Also [here's most of our course & exercises](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211970?module_item_id=504417) (besides ch9's [course](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211716?module_item_id=504262) & [exercises](https://canvas.kdg.be/courses/29944/files/2211735?module_item_id=504261) )
- If you for some reason think theses notes look good, I wrote down how I make them [here](https://github.com/Denperidge-School/mathematics-notes#readme)
